             Install NRPE agent on your Remote Linux host
What is NRPE?

The NRPE (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor) plugin allows you to monitor any remote Linux/Unix services or network devices. This NRPE add-on allows Nagios to monitor any local resources like CPU load, Swap, Memory usage, online users, etc. on remote Linux machines. After all, these local resources are not mostly exposed to external machines, an NRPE agent must be installed and configured on the remote machines.

Step 1: Install Required Dependencies
# yum install -y gcc glibc glibc-common gd gd-devel make net-snmp openssl-devel

Step2: Install nagios-plugins and nagios-nrpe-server

#apt-get install nagios-plugins nagios-nrpe-server

Step 2: Configuring NRPE
Next, open the /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg file. Replace the value of allowed hosts with 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0 replacing the second IP with the IP address of the Nagios server.
We will now open the file /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg and replace a couple of values.
Replace the value of server_address to the private IP address of the host.
     Set allowed_hosts to the private IP address of your Nagios server.
     Execute df -h /, copy the output, and put that as the value of command. It indicates your root file system. Save the file when you are finished. Now restart NRPE:
#service nagios-nrpe-server restart

Step 3: Adding the host to Nagios
Now that we've configured the host we're going to monitor, we need to switch back to our Nagios server and add the host to it. Open the following file with nano editor:
#/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/host.cfg
Use the following block as a template. Replace host with an appropriate name for your remote host, and update the host_name, alias, and address values accordingly.
define host {
      use                       linux-server
      host_name                 yourhost
      alias                     My first Apache server
      address                   1.2.3.4
      max_check_attempts        5
      check_period              24x7
      notification_interval     30
      notification_period       24x7
}
