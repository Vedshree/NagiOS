1. Installing Nagios 4.3.4 and Nagios Plugin 2.2.1

1.	Nagios and its plugins will be installed under /usr/local/nagios directory.
2.	Nagios will be configured to monitor few services of your local machine (Disk Usage, CPU Load, Current Users, Total Processes, etc.)
3.	Nagios web interface will be available at http://localhost/nagios



Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

We need to install Apache, PHP and some libraries like gcc, glibc, glibc-common and GD libraries and its development libraries before installing Nagios 4.3.4 with source. And to do so, we can use yum default package installer.
•	# yum install -y httpd httpd-tools php gcc glibc glibc-common gd gd-devel make net-snmp

Step 2: Create Nagios User and Group

Create a new nagios user and nagcmd group account and set a password.
•	# useradd nagios
•	# groupadd nagcmd

Next, add both the nagios user and the apache user to the nagcmd group.
•	 # usermod -G nagcmd nagios
•	# usermod -G nagcmd apache

Step 3: Download Nagios Core 4.3.4 and Nagios Plugin 2.2.1

           Create a directory for your Nagios installation and all its future downloads.
•	# mkdir /root/nagios
•	# cd /root/nagios
.wget utility which retrieves files from World Wide Web (WWW) using widely used protocols like HTTP, HTTPS and FTP. Wget utility is freely available package and license is under GNU GPL License. This utility can be install any Unix-like Operating system including Windows and MAC OS.
Wget automatically start download where it was left off in case of network problem. Also downloads file recursively. It’ll keep trying until file has be retrieved completely.
Check whether wget utility is already installed or not in your Linux box, using following command.

•	# rpm -qa wget

Install it using YUM command in case wget is not installed already
•	# yum -y install wget

Now download latest Nagios Core 4.3.4 and Nagios plugins 2.2.1 packages with wget command
•	# wget https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.3.4.tar.gz
•	# wget https://nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.2.1.tar.gz


Step 4: Extract Nagios Core and its Plugins

          We need to extract downloaded package with commands so, first we install unzip
•	# yum install unzip
•	# tar -xvf nagios-4.3.4.tar.gz
•	# tar -xvf nagios-plugins-2.2.1.tar.gz
 

When you extract these tarballs with tar command, two new folders will appear in that directory...
•	# ls –l

Configure Nagios Core

Now, first we will configure Nagios Core and to do so we need to go to Nagios directory and run configure file.

•	# cd nagios-4.3.4/
•	# . /configure --with-command-group=nagcmd

After configuring, we need to compile and install all the binaries with make all and make install command, it will install all the needed libraries in your machine and we can proceed further.

•	# make all
•	# make install

Install the init scripts for Nagios.

•	# make install-init



To make nagios work from command line we need to install command-mode.

•	# make install-commandmode

Next, install sample nagios files

•	# make install-config


Step 5: Customizing Nagios Configuration

Open the “contacts.cfg” file with your choice of editor and set the email address associated with the nagiosadmin contact definition to receiving email alerts.

•	# vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg


Step 6: Install and Configure Web Interface for Nagios

We are done with all configuration in the backend, now we will configure Web Interface for Nagios with following command. The below command will Configure Web interface for Nagios and a web admin user will be created “nagiosadmin”.

•	# make install-webconf

In this step, we will be creating a password for “nagiosadmin”. After executing this command, please provide a password twice and keep it remember because this password will be used when you login in the Nagios Web interface.

•	# htpasswd -s -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin

Restart Apache to make the new settings take effect.

•	# service httpd start

•	# systemctl start httpd.service


Step 7: Compile and Install Nagios Plugin

We have downloaded nagios plugins in /root/nagios, Go there and configure and install it

•	# cd /root/nagios

•	# cd nagios-plugins-2.2.1/

•	# ./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios

•	# make

•	# make install

Step 8: Verify Nagios Configuration Files
	
Now we are all done with Nagios configuration and it’s time to verify it and to do so please insert following command.
•	# /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

Step 9: Add Nagios Services to System Startup
   	
To make Nagios work across reboots, we need to add nagios and httpd with chkconfig and systemctl command.

•	# chkconfig --add nagios
•	# chkconfig --level 35 nagios on
•	# chkconfig --add httpd
•	# chkconfig --level 35 httpd on

•	# systemctl enable nagios
•	# systemctl enable httpd

Restart Nagios to make the new settings take effect.
•	# service nagios start  
•	# systemctl start nagios.service
Turn off the firewall of Linux system &windows system
•	# systemctl stop firewalld

For Windows:-

Open settings, go to Network and Internet, then windows firewall & off the firewall.


Step 10: Login to the Nagios Web Interface
Your nagios is ready to work, please open it in your browser with “http://Your-server-IP-address/nagios” or “http://FQDN/nagios” and provide the username “nagiosadmin” and password.

Upgrade Nagios 3.x to Nagios 4.3.4
If you are already running an older version of Nagios, you can upgrade it anytime. To do so, you just need to download the latest tar archive of it.
•	# service nagios stop
•	# wget https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.3.4.tar.gz
•	# tar -zxvf nagios-4.3.4.tar.gz
•	# cd nagios-4.3.4
•	# . /configure
•	# make all
